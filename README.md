### What was asked of us ? <a name="Intro"></a>
We were tasked by our teacher to create an application using Java FX. There were no restrictions on what we could make other than the application had to use Java FX and it had to be appropriate for university. Given the freedom we were given, the choice between a complex and a simple application was hard but in the end simplicity won. We chose to do a simple calculator, like something that you would find on your phone or tablet.
